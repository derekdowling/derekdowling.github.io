Assignment: CSS Hell
====================

No installation is required to get everything up and running. Normally I would
not include a beefy vendor folder, but I didn't want you to have to install any
tools or run any commands via bower or npm to get this thing working.

Modifications To HTML
===

* Inserted CSS link below inline CSS
* Changed Chapter Headers in Huckleberry Finn to use `<h2>`
* Appended class="toc" to Chapter Listings in Huckleberry Finn
